##Hypothesis 3

This script tests hypothesis three: that planting tree seedlings, as carried out by the USFS, will improve longterm tree regeneration outcomes compared to adjacent sites with the same topographic position and burn severity that did not receive planting. The dependent variable is % change in forest area over the time between 1992 and 2016 within stands (aka clusters/patches) that have similar aspect and burn severity. Percent change in forest was generated using NLCD data showing if each pixel is classified as forest or not forest. The hypothesis was tested with a differnces in differences approach whereby the null hypothesis was that non-planted sites were assumed to have the same rate of tree recovery in burned patches as compared to the adjacent control area (ie.. that didn't receive planting).

**Fire year**: 1987
**Study area**: The Klamath Ecoregion
**Pixels included**: Mixed conifer forest as classified by Landfire's biophysical settings, identified as being conifer before the fire (as classified from a random forest algorithm), that burned at medium or high severity (MTBS), and that were classified as non-forest in 1992 from NLCD data 5 years after the fire. Essentially, the study pixels included experienced stand-replacing fires in 1987 that occured in mixed conifer forest.


##Also included in this Script
##Stand-level recovery trajectories
Some visualizations of the % change in pixels classified as forest in recovering stands

##Comparisons of NBR across vegetation types
This script aslo includes some visualizations of NBR stratified by vegetation type (as classified by NLCD)

##NBR recovery trajectories
Also includes some NBR recovering trajectories

Quantifying how many pixels went from non-forest back to forest in their post-fire regeneration trajectory. These are the pixels of interest for this analysis because we are not interested in pixels that were never denuded of forest.
```{r}
`%notin%` <- Negate(`%in%`)

nonForest2001 <- df %>%
  filter(year == 2001, landcover_code %notin% 41:43) %>%
  pull(pixelID) %>% unique()

#how many pixels went from shrub to tree
df %>%
  filter(pixelID %in% nonForest2001) %>%
  filter(year == 2016, landcover_code %in% 41:43) %>%
  pull(pixelID) %>% unique() %>% length()

```

Plotting the fraction of pixels in each patch that were classified as forest in multiple years since the time of fire. The below plot shows these fractions from 1992 to 2016 (the fire was in 1987).
```{r}
#create a data frame of the change in forest cover for each patch (cluster = patch)
length(clusters_with_more_than8_pixels) # number of patches in the sample. Patches with less than 8 pixels were excluded.
patches <- sample(clusters_with_more_than8_pixels,100)

df %>%
  filter(burnSev > 1) %>%
  filter(clusterID %in% clusters_with_more_than8_pixels) %>%
  drop_na(land_cover_name) %>%
  group_by(clusterID,year) %>%
  summarise(pct_tree = sum(landcover_code %in% 41:43) / length(landcover_code)) %>%

```


Whats the distribution of changes in the fractional area of tree cover between 2016 and 1992 for the patches in our sample? Below we see that most patches did not change their area of tree cover, while some accumulated tree cover and some lost tree cover.


```{r}

            n_pixels = length(unique(pixelID))) %>%
  group_by(clusterID) %>%
  summarise(pct_change_tree = pct_tree[year==2016] - pct_tree[year==1992],
            n_pixels = head(n_pixels,1))

  group_by(clusterID) %>%
  summarise_if(is.factor,getmode) 

#instead of calculating the mode of the facts treatments in each patch, here we create another variable that says a patch is "treated" (i.e. logical value of `1`) if any pixel in the patch was treated.

facts_treatment_df_v2 <- df %>%
  select(clusterID,pixelID,factsTreatmentCode) %>%
  group_by(clusterID) %>%
  summarise(factsTreatment = max(factsTreatmentCode)) %>%
  mutate(factsTreatmentLogical = factor(as.numeric(factsTreatment > 1)))

Analyzing the effect of the USFS planting trees on the future physiognomic class in fire-affected pixels using data from the Forest Activity Tracking System dataset.

A first look at % of pixels transitioning from non-forest to forest in treated (planted) and untreated pixels.

  filter(year == 1992, landcover_code %notin% 41:43) %>% pull(pixelID)
forest2016 <- df %>% 
  select(pixelID, year, landcover_code, factsTreatmentCode) %>%
  filter(year == 2016, landcover_code %in% 41:43) %>% pull(pixelID)
transition2forest <- unique(df$pixelID[(df$pixelID %in% nonforest1992) & (df$pixelID %in% forest2016)])

#transition2forest

```


Setting up a datafram to test the difference in differences between paired control and planted pixels. Groups of pixels that are in the same patch, but that differ in their treatement (planted vs. not planted) are matched.

  select(clusterID, pixelID, year, landcover_code, factsTreatmentCode) %>%
  mutate(transitioned = pixelID %in% transition2forest) %>%
  mutate(planting = factsTreatmentCode %in% c(4431,4432)) %>%
  #filter(clusterID %in% cluster_with_treatment) %>%

  mutate(treatment = case_when(
    (pl == 0 ~ "control"),
    (pl == 1 ~ "planted")

The dependent variable (y axis in figure above) needs to be log transformed for statistical analysis because it is not normally distributed. A log transform resolves this.
```{r}
facts_treatment_df %>%
ggplot(aes(frac_tr)) +
geom_histogram()

facts_treatment_df %>%
ggplot(aes(log(frac_tr))) +
geom_histogram()
```

A paired t-test shows that planting does increase forest regeneration 30 years after fire.
```{r}
clusters_with_treatment <- facts_treatment_df %>%
  drop_na(clusterID) %>%
  group_by(clusterID) %>%
  summarise(nb = length(n)) %>%
  filter(nb > 1) %>% pull(clusterID)

facts_treatment_df %>% filter(clusterID %in% clusters_with_treatment)

t.test(lnfrac_tr ~ pl, 
       data = facts_treatment_df %>% filter(clusterID %in% clusters_with_treatment),
       paired = TRUE)
```


But, in what scenarios does planting help the most compared to control? The correlation plot below suggests that "tr_diff" (the difference in the % of pixels transitioning back to forest between the treatment group and the paired control group) is positively correlated with slope, eastness, and pre-Fire NBR value. Therefore, we can assume that planting helps regeneration the most on steeper slopes, east-facing slopes, and in locations where there was thicker vegetation before the fire. This last variable could be a proxy for "site potential".
```{r}
facts_cor_data <- facts_treatment_df %>% 
  filter(clusterID %in% clusters_with_treatment) %>%
  select(-n_tr, -n,-lnfrac_tr, -pl) %>%
  spread(key = treatment, value = frac_tr) %>%
  mutate(tr_diff = planted - control) %>%
  select(-control,-planted) %>%
  left_join(patch_level_continuous_vars, by = "clusterID") %>%
  left_join(patch_level_categorical_vars, by = "clusterID") %>%
  ungroup %>%
  select(-factsTreatmentCode, -clusterID) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  drop_na()

corr <- facts_cor_data %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  cor() %>% round(1)

Pmat <- facts_cor_data %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  cor_pmat()

ggcorrplot(corr, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower",
   lab = TRUE, p.mat = Pmat)
```



```{r}
facts_cor_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = preFireNBR, y = tr_diff)) +
  geom_point()
```






##Appendix. Exploring NBR recovery over time.
Adding the % NBR recovey to the df. %NBR recovery is the fraction of mean pre-fire NBR

Showing the distribution of NBR values for pixels classified as forest for NLCD
```{r}

df %>%
  drop_na(land_cover_name) %>%
  filter(landcover_code %in% c(41:42, 71,51,52)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=NBR, fill=land_cover_name)) +
  geom_density( color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.6, position = 'identity') +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("light green", "dark green", "yellow", "brown")) +
  #theme_ipsum() +
  labs(fill="") +
  adams_theme


```


Plotting the patch-level NBR through time for a random sample of patches. We see that NBR starts to saturate (i.e. reach the pre-fire NBR value) within about 10-15 years. This is despite the fact that pixels have not actually returned to forest. This is evidence that using NBR is not suitable of measuring forest recovery.
```{r}
#patches <- sample(unique(df$clusterID),100)

df %>%
  group_by(FireID, clusterID, year) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,mean) %>%
  #filter(clusterID %in% patches) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year,NBR,color = clusterID)) +
  geom_line() +
  adams_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


Plotting the percent NBR recovery for each patch. This shows NBR as a percent of the pre-fire values.
```{r}
#patches <- sample(unique(df$clusterID),10)
df %>%
  group_by(clusterID, year) %>%
  #filter(WID > 0) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,mean) %>%
  #filter(clusterID %in% patches) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year,pct_nbr_recovery,color = clusterID)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylim(c(-1,1.5)) +
  adams_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
