# Decadal-scale post-fire conifer regeneration in the Klamath National Forest

This research builds off of prior studies (Tepley et al. 2017, Shive et al. 2018, and Young et al. 2019) which seek to predict natural conifer regeneration probabilities as functions of fire characteristics, site conditions, seed availability, climate, and short-term weather in the years following fire. What makes this approach different is the focus on longer term regeneration outcomes rather than looking at the density of seedlings and saplings in the post-fire plant community. We explicitly incorporate post-fire management variables (i.e. spatially explicit data on tree planting events) from the USFS FACTS database. 

**The overarching research questions** are 1) What fire attributes, site characteristics, and climate variables influence conifer forest recovery in severley burned patches? 2) Under what circumstances does tree planting influence the forest recovery outcomes?


##Hypotheses
See corresponding .md files for tests of each hypothesis

###Hypothesis 1


###Hypothesis 2
The same variables that predict short term seedling recovery (hypothesis 1) will predict conifer canopy dominance 30 yrs after fire

###Hypothesis 3
Planting tree seedlings, as carried out by the USFS, will improve longterm tree regeneration outcomes compared to adjacent sites with the same topographic position and burn severity that did not receive planting.
